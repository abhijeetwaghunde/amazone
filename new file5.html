	<p style="color:black;font-size:45px;">Parshurama was the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu. He was born to the Brahman Sage Jamadagni and the princess Renuka, one of the Saptarishis. Though he was born in the Brahmin family, he carried Khatriya traits like aggressiveness, warfare and valour. Hence he is known as “Brahmin-Kshatriya”.</P>
