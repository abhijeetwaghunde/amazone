		The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by 
		nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, 
		providing most of the energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject
		for astronomical research since ancient times.The Sun moves around the Galactic Center of the Milky Way at a distance of 26,660 light-years. 
		From Earth, it is on average 1 AU (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi; 4.64 ls), 
		109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[17]
		Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of
		heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

		In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio.
		This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars". god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods.
		Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years.
		Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Venus has a weak induced magnetosphere. The planet has a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with a sulfuric acid cloud cover,
		which creates an extreme greenhouse effect. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid.
		Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment,[22][23] but runaway greenhouse effects evaporated any water,
		which then escaped into space.[24][25][26] Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System that have no moons.
		The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction  and drag of its atmosphere.It takes 224.7 Earth days for Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun.

		This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.
		The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined.
		Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which  from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry.

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust,
		giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky and its high-contrast albedo features have make it a common subject for telescope viewing.
		It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days).
		Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.When viewed closely, the relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in southern highlands – this terrain observation is known as the Martian dichotomy.
		Mars hosts many enormous extinct volcanos (such as Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
		Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.Jupiter was the first planet to form,
		and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume.The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior  from the Sun.Its internal structure

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
		It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30] Even though Saturn is nearly the size of Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass.
		Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 years.Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer.
		Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Like Neptune, it is an ice giant.
		It is the third largest planet in the solar system.The planet is made of ice, gases and liquid metal. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen (1H), helium (2He) and methane. The temperature on Uranus is −197 °C (−322.6 °F; 76.1 K) near the top of its atmosphere.
		Its small solid core (about 55% the mass of Earth) is probably about 4,730 °C (8,540 °F; 5,000 K).The planet is tilted on its axis so much that it is sideways.[22] The cause of this is not known for certain. It has five big moons, many small ones, and a small system of 13 planetary rings.
		The distance between Uranus and the Sun is about 2.8 billion km. Uranus completes its orbit around the Sun in 84 earth years. It completes a spin around its axis in 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means there are about 43,000 Uranian days in one Uranian year.[23]Uranus was discovered in 1781.

	<p align="center" style="color:pink;font-size:25;margin:70px 0px 0px 0px">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
		It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface.
		The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was found from mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations rather than being initially observed by direct empirical observation.

		It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets.
		Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume.Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi).
		Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.making a flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements and observations.
