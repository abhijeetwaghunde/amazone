	<p style="color:black; font-size:45px;">The story of Matsy a Avatar is somewhat similar to that of Noah in the Bible. According to Matsya Purana, Lord Vishnu incarnated as half-fish and half-human and guided the king Satyavrat (Manu) to save himself, seeds of the plants, herbs, and mobile living creatures on the earth at the time of the great flood.</p>

			<strong> kurma</strong>

	<img src="kurma.jpg" style= "margin-top:1.5%;padding-right:30px;" align="right" width="400" height="300";>
	<p style="color:black;font-size:45px;">Kurma, the second avatar of Vishnu, is depicted in the water holding up Mount Mandāra, chosen as a churning rod upon which Vishnu himself is seated. The snake Vāsuki, coiled around it, serves as a rope which is being pulled on the left by the gods Brahmā, Vishnu and Shiva, and on the right by three demons.</P>
